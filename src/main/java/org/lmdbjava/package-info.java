/**
 * Lightning Memory Database (LMDB) for Java (LmdbJava).
 *
 * <p>LmdbJava is intended for extremely low latency use cases. Users are required to understand and
 * comply with the LMDB C API contract (eg handle usage patterns, thread binding, process rules).
 *
 * <p>Priorities:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Minimize latency, particularly on any critical path (see below)
 *   <li>Preserve the LMDB C API model as far as practical
 *   <li>Apply Java idioms only when not in conflict with the above
 *   <li>Fully encapsulate (hide) the native call library and patterns
 *   <li>Don't require runtime dependencies beyond the native call library
 *   <li>Support official JVMs running on typical 64-bit operating systems
 *   <li>Prepare for Java 9 (eg Unsafe, native call technology roadmap etc)
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Critical paths of special latency focus:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Releasing and renewing a read-only transaction
 *   <li>Any operation that uses a cursor
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The classes in LmdbJava DO NOT provide any concurrency guarantees. Instead you MUST observe
 * LMDB's specific thread rules (eg do not share transactions between threads). LmdbJava does not
 * shield you from these requirements, as doing so would impose locking overhead on use cases that
 * may not require it or have already carefully implemented application threading (as most low
 * latency applications do to optimize the memory hierarchy, core pinning etc).
 *
 * <p>Most methods in this package will throw a standard Java exception for failing preconditions
 * (eg {@link NullPointerException} if a mandatory argument was missing) or a subclass of {@link
 * LmdbException} for precondition or LMDB C failures. The majority of LMDB exceptions indicate an
 * API usage or {@link Env} configuration issues, and as such are typically unrecoverable.
